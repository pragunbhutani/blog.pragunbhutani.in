          <section class="content"><p>From this point on, I am going to proudly, ideologically and irrevocably become a&nbsp;hobbit.</p>
<p>There isn‘t one good reason that tells me that I shouldn’t do this. One the other hand, there are so many that compel me to! There‘re second breakfasts and mushrooms, there’s beer, more food in general and enough happiness to go around. Making the decision was the easy bit though. The hard part is actually doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I mean, how does a person even go about doing something like this? Do I wait till things in life settle down so I can be happy and chilled out? But you can never be sure of that. There&#39;s always something or the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>And then, this is the first time I‘ve had to start thinking about taking responsibility for myself. I don’t know how things are going to pan out in the future. What if life never does really ‘settle down’? Even if it did, would I like it that way? It‘s like this journey that you have to begin and I think the only way I’m going to make it somewhere if I learn to take some joy in the road. Beer and second breakfasts can certainly help.&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>So I think I‘m just going to wing it. Try to be happy about stuff, go about my jolly little trade and enjoy the small things as they pass by. Us Hobbits don’t have to ‘grow up’ till we‘re 30, so I think I can take things slow for now and enjoy the journey. I don’t know if it&#39;ll work, but it seems good enough to warrant a&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>In line with that spirit, I&#39;m sitting here with a hot cup of coffee on a deliciously cold evening, listening to nice music and writing down this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>I like the hobbit&#39;s life&nbsp;already.</p>
