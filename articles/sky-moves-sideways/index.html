          <section class="content"><p>I like to look up at the sky sometimes. Not very often, but every now and then and especially at night. There are very few things that can blow your mind in the same way that a night sky can. It‘s not really the vastness or the blackness or the number of things out there that gets you. It’s this feeling of being&nbsp;disconnected.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>The world that we interact with in our daily lives, the people that we meet and the things we do all seem so very strangely real in the face of the feeling that you get when you‘re looking up. Out there is a realm so unimaginably vast and complex and beautiful that I cannot even begin to comprehend. Yet, ours is a part of that larger world that goes on in ways that we understand so little of. I’ve never been able to put these two together and see them as one. Every time I‘ve tried to think and reason into this, I’ve always ended up with more questions than I began&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>I‘ve imagined myself flying out at times, accelerating away from the Earth and Sun and the solar system as if gravity wasn’t even a thing. Those trips are always fun. You can go on for quite a while, marveling at the scale of things till you hit the “Roof problem” as I like to call it. The way I understand things, everything has to be inside something right? Like, if I was flying away from the Earth, I‘d be in the Solar System. Moving on, I’d pass Neptune and Pluto and then the Oort cloud. Further still, I‘d cross Proxima Centaury and eventually escape the Milky Way. Where to then? To the boundaries of our universe? What does that even mean? How can we be so sure that the universe isn’t inside something else? And what about the container of the universe… what is that thing inside of? The problem iterates upon&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>I‘m not really sure where I was going with all this. If I had an idea at the beginning, I know it’s ‘out there’ somewhere but I‘m pretty sure I’ve lost it completely. The one thing that I&#39;m really sure of though is&nbsp;that,</p>

<p>Damn right it&nbsp;can&#39;t.</p>
