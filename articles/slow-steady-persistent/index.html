          <section class="content"><p>I completed my first week of <span class="caps">P90X</span> today. It‘s this new workout plan that I’ve started following. I‘ve been in and out of things like this before but I don’t think that I‘ve ever stayed strong through an entire week. I’ve just got 84 more days to go now.&nbsp;Easy.</p>
<p>Slow. Steady. Persistent. Those three words have been running through my head for the last couple of days. You see, there‘s always this huge gap between the person that you want to be and the person that you are. Same’s the case with me. A little over a month ago, I made the decision to start bridging that gap and the only way I think I&#39;ll be able to do that is by being slow, steady and&nbsp;persistent.</p>
<p>I owe this realization to <span class="caps">P90X</span> perhaps. I‘ve really started enjoying the daily workouts and the fact that I don’t have to think about anything else while I‘m doing them. I’m not worried about how far I‘ve come along the program. I’m not worried about how I‘m going to go about finishing the entire program. I’m not trying to keep myself motivated to stick with the plan for the next 12&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>I try to motivate myself to stick with it everyday. Every single day, and only one day at a time. Worrying can be such a handicap! What with our tendency to start looking at a task in its entirety and start worrying about how we&#39;re going to go through with it. I now understand that breaking things into small portions makes them so much easier to manage. I sure hope this applies to things other than exercise programs as&nbsp;well!</p>
<p>It&#39;s time for me to find&nbsp;out.</p>
