          <section class="content"><p>So I received a surprise by snail mail today! I remember Lydia telling me that there was going to be something coming my way but I sort of imagined that it would be a Wikidata T-shirt. Well it wasn&#39;t just that!!
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p><a href="/articles/wikidata-sends-goodies/Wikidata-Goodies.png">Wikidata&nbsp;Goodies</a></p>
<p>T-shirts, badges, stickers, lanyards, baggage tags, erasers, pencils <span class="caps">AND</span> notebooks. The best part is that card, signed by everybody at the Wikidata team and a little note that says, “Thanks for your GSoC work :)”, which I really wasn&#39;t expecting to receive! Thanks a ton guys, it&#39;s a beautiful gesture and I really really really appreciate&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>So coooool! This is the first time I&#39;ve received goodies from any open source organisation and it feels so awesome! :D
I guess they‘ve sent me all this stuff because I told them that we’re planning the next big <span class="caps">JIIT</span> Open Source Developers Conference soon we always need&nbsp;goodies.</p>
<p>I‘m going to carry the stuff to the next <span class="caps">OSDC</span> meeting and I’m already sure that they&#39;re going to be thrilled. Three cheers to&nbsp;Wikidata!</p>
