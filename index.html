          <section class="content"><p>Throughout my years of engineering, I&#39;ve thought about this question a countless number of times. “Why did I decide to study engineering?” In part, it could have been because of all the promises of riches and glory that the life of an engineer brings, that we were told as kids in this country. How ironic it is to have such a multitude of engineers in a place so annoyingly under-engineered! I digress, sorry. That topic in itself deserves to be expounded upon in a series of&nbsp;articles.</p>
<p>So, was it for the riches? I don‘t know. I don’t think&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to think back to the times when I was a kid and my mind wasn&#39;t encumbered with illusions of reality, I realize that maybe this was the person I was meant to be from the get go. Right from the very beginning, I was interested in understanding how things (anything and everything)&nbsp;worked!</p>
<p>It began with my fascination with car engines, my first ‘Mechanix’ toy kit and the rabbit hole just kept on going deeper and&nbsp;deeper…</p>
<p>How did a switch make the fan go round? Why does turning the knob make it go faster? How did the hairdresser‘s spray turn water into that fine, cool mist? What made aeroplanes fly? What exactly is ’fire&#39; and why is it the way it&nbsp;is?</p>
<p>I can‘t remember a time in my life when I wasn’t pursuing one such curiosity or another. Like I said, I guess I was plonked into this world as a tinker destined to become an engineer some day. That unending desire to figure out the nuts and bolts of everything. When computers came along, I was naturally taken in by the wonders of this magical device that could make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language">turtle</a>#Turtle_and_graphics) draw all forms of shapes and figures by the command of a few words! That fascination sowed the seeds of what was to become my decision to study Computer Science at&nbsp;college.</p>
<p>Somewhere during my first year though, I forgot about all of this. I think it was a fear of commitment that gripped me. Or maybe a nagging voice inside that kept telling me that I hadn‘t even been exposed to all that was ’out there‘ and all I could be. Four years of stumbling and wandering have brought me to this point where I’m once again aware of who I&nbsp;am.</p>
<p>And I am not&nbsp;afraid.</p>

          <section class="content"><p><a href="http://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> is a great cloud platform that allows you to build powerful telephony apps in a breeze. Now I&#39;m not much of a developer, but when I was asked to use it and build an app, I decided to give it a spin!
It was a little intimidating at first, but fortunately Plivo has very well documented code and a fantastic set of helper functions that made my job so much&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>The idea for my app came from the need to make sure that people don‘t miss courier deliveries. I, for one, hate it when I’ve purchased something online and miss the shipment when there&#39;s noone there to receive it. Courier companies must not be very fond of it either, seeing as they have to then ship it all over again. Such a terrible waste of manpower&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>How cool would it be if on the morning of your delivery, the courier-system could place an auto-generated <span class="caps">IVR</span> call or send a text to the delivery recipients asking them if they&#39;d be available to receive their deliveries that&nbsp;day?</p>
<p>Skadool is my attempt to create such an app. I‘ve used Plivo’s framework to power it. I added a small <span class="caps">API</span>(my first, in fact!) to it to allow potential courier companies to handle the CRUD of this&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>Code and documentation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/blotmandroid/skadool"><a href="https://github.com/blotmandroid/skadool">https://github.com/blotmandroid/skadool</a></a>.</p>
<p>I welcome any and all feedback!&nbsp;:)</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/becoming-hobbit/">Becoming Hobbit</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>From this point on, I am going to proudly, ideologically and irrevocably become a&nbsp;hobbit.</p>
<p>There isn‘t one good reason that tells me that I shouldn’t do this. One the other hand, there are so many that compel me to! There‘re second breakfasts and mushrooms, there’s beer, more food in general and enough happiness to go around. Making the decision was the easy bit though. The hard part is actually doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I mean, how does a person even go about doing something like this? Do I wait till things in life settle down so I can be happy and chilled out? But you can never be sure of that. There&#39;s always something or the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>And then, this is the first time I‘ve had to start thinking about taking responsibility for myself. I don’t know how things are going to pan out in the future. What if life never does really ‘settle down’? Even if it did, would I like it that way? It‘s like this journey that you have to begin and I think the only way I’m going to make it somewhere if I learn to take some joy in the road. Beer and second breakfasts can certainly help.&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>So I think I‘m just going to wing it. Try to be happy about stuff, go about my jolly little trade and enjoy the small things as they pass by. Us Hobbits don’t have to ‘grow up’ till we‘re 30, so I think I can take things slow for now and enjoy the journey. I don’t know if it&#39;ll work, but it seems good enough to warrant a&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>In line with that spirit, I&#39;m sitting here with a hot cup of coffee on a deliciously cold evening, listening to nice music and writing down this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>I like the hobbit&#39;s life&nbsp;already.</p>
