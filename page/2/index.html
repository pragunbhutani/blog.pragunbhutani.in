          <section class="content"><p><a href="http://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> is a great cloud platform that allows you to build powerful telephony apps in a breeze. Now I&#39;m not much of a developer, but when I was asked to use it and build an app, I decided to give it a spin!
It was a little intimidating at first, but fortunately Plivo has very well documented code and a fantastic set of helper functions that made my job so much&nbsp;easier.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>From this point on, I am going to proudly, ideologically and irrevocably become a&nbsp;hobbit.</p>
<p>There isn‘t one good reason that tells me that I shouldn’t do this. One the other hand, there are so many that compel me to! There‘re second breakfasts and mushrooms, there’s beer, more food in general and enough happiness to go around. Making the decision was the easy bit though. The hard part is actually doing&nbsp;it.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I like to look up at the sky sometimes. Not very often, but every now and then and especially at night. There are very few things that can blow your mind in the same way that a night sky can. It‘s not really the vastness or the blackness or the number of things out there that gets you. It’s this feeling of being&nbsp;disconnected.</p>
